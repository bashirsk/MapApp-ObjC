# MapApp-ObjC

###  I'm currently learninh Objective-C so i have started translating all the small apps i have made on Github in Objective-C. I consider this an effective way to learn and get upto speed with Swift. MapApp is a small app that was written for a technical interview in Swift. I will be replicating it using Objective-C
